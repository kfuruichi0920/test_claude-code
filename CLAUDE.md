# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a test repository for claude-code functionality verification (claude-codeの動作確認用). The repository currently contains minimal structure with only a README file in Japanese.

## Project Structure

The repository is in its initial state with:
- A basic README.md file describing the repository's purpose as a testing ground for claude-code
- Git repository initialized with main branch
- No package managers or build systems configured yet
- No existing source code or application structure

## Development Notes

Since this is a test repository for claude-code verification, development commands and architecture will depend on what gets added during testing. The repository appears to be set up specifically for experimenting with Claude Code functionality.
